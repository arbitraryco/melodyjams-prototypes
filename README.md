Melody Jams Prototypes
===================
These Swift 3 recreations of some of the original prototypes for Melody Jams.

The problem statements we aimed to answer were as follows:

- [How do I create an iOS app?](ios/JK001InitialApp)
- [How do I create an iOS game?](ios/JK002SpriteKit)
- [How do I create a thing in the game?](ios/JK003Circle)
- [How can I tap on that thing?](ios/JK004InteractiveCircle)
- [How do I drag a thing?](ios/JK005DraggableCircle)
- [How do I have multiple things I can drag?](ios/JK006MultipleCircles)
- [How do I detect when one thing is near another thing?](ios/JK007CircleDistanceDetection)

Rules
-------------------
- PRs are unneccessary and discouraged. Just work.
- Branches are fine, but commit back into master. Again, just work.
- One directory per platform (e.g. `python`, `ios`, `web`)
- Subdirectories should be formatted as such: JK001BriefDescription
	- Begin with your initials.
	- Add a three digit incrementing number, so everyone can see progress.
	- Add a brief description of what the prototype does.
	- Each subdirectory should ideally contain a README.md explaining what the prototype does.
	- Feel free to riff on one other's prototypes.
